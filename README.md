# Arachne-Race-1.0
 Backup and Final ver. of Arachne Race for 1.0 Rimworld

Adds a playable Arachne race

REQUIRES HUMANOID ALIEN RACES 2.0 INSTALLED AND ACTIVATED BEFORE THIS MOD

Centuries ago, alien spacecraft crashlanded on Arachne homeworld.
The Arachne saw the potential of space travel to expand their colony to outer space.
Arachne's technology advanced few hundred years from researching the alien spacecraft artifacts!
Now, they officially launched few dozen colony ship with you as part of the dozens colony ship.
The mission? Establish a colony. Expand. Conquer.

Some Arachne lost their minds being stuck in ships for too long, they have forgotten their mission and they have form their own militia faction.
Beware, they will come, they will attack you...

+ Good with animal
+ Less toxic sensitive
+ Cold tolerance (min temp -8c)
+ Arachne get small bonusses to melee combat stat
+ 2 stage of heal regen - Weak: can recover from bleeding - Strong: can regrow limb

- Bad with plants
- Bad with social
- Psychic sensitive
- Heat sensitive (max temp 18c)

NOTE
Heal regen works similarly like healing factor in Logann race mod but a mix of stage 1~3 healing with the ability to regrow limb (strong). Basically weaker healing.
Please report if arachne militia raid is too OP or underpowered.
Yes they are supposed to be tough enemies for you, but not too over powered.

COMPATIBILITY
Facial Stuff - Might not be compatible

KNOWN ISSUE
- Very rarely theres a graphical bug on dead or down arachne, body detach from spider body or both the detach body spinning independently. I've only seen this happen twice.
- Traps gender - Its not supposed to spawn male arachne, but it may happen, and if it did, Grats! You got yourself traps.
